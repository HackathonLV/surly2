Surly2 is a half-complete node.js AIML interpreter with a bad attitude.

Surly2 is a remake from the ground up of [Surly](http://github.com/mrchimp/surly) using Node 5 and using as much asynchronicity as possible.


Status
======

Some stuff works. Check out `COVERAGE.md` for full details. I wouldn't try using it for anything serious quite yet.


Requirements
============

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)


Installation
============

 1. Acquire code
 2. `npm install`


Usage
=====

1. `node cli.js`
2. Type some stuff.


Config
======

Config files are found and read by [rc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc). Check the "Configuration File Formats" section of the `rc` readme for more instructions. Any flag shown in `node cli.js --help` can be set in the options file.
